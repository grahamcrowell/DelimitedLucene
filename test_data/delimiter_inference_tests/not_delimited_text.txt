INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE
Introduction
1  The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race  They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries_ but they have destabilized society_ have made life unfulfilling_ have subjected human beings to indignities_ have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world  The continued development of technology will worsen the situation  It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world_ it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering_ and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries 
2  The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down  If it survives_ it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering_ but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine  Furthermore_ if the system survives_ the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy 
3  If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful  But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be_ so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later 
4  We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system  This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades  We can’t predict any of that  But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society  This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution  Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society 
5  In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system  Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether  This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant  For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say  For example_ since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements_ we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature_ even though we consider these to be highly important 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM
6  Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society  One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism_ so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general 
7  But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism  Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist  When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists_ collectivists_ “politically correct” types_ feminists_ gay and disability activists_ animal rights activists and the like  But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist  What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type_ or rather a collection of related types  Thus_ what we mean by “leftism” will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology  (Also_ see paragraphs 227-230 )
8  Even so_ our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish_ but there doesn’t seem to be any remedy for this  All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism  We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology  Also_ our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only  We leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries 
9  The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call “feelings of inferiority” and “oversocialization ” Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole_ while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential 
FEELINGS OF INFERIORITY
10  By “feelings of inferiority” we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low self-esteem_ feelings of powerlessness_ depressive tendencies_ defeatism_ guilt_ self- hatred_ etc  We argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism 
11  When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem  This tendency is pronounced among minority rights activists_ whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend  They are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities  The terms “negro_” “oriental_” “handicapped” or “chick” for an African_ an Asian_ a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation  “Broad” and “chick” were merely the feminine equivalents of “guy_” “dude” or “fellow ” The negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves  Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word “pet” and insist on its replacement by “animal companion ” Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative  They want to replace the world “primitive” by “nonliterate ” They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own  (We do not mean to imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours  We merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists )
12  Those who are most sensitive about “politically incorrect” terminology are not the average black ghetto- dweller_ Asian immigrant_ abused woman or disabled person_ but a minority of activists_ many of whom do not even belong to any “oppressed” group but come from privileged strata of society  Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors_ who have secure employment with comfortable salaries_ and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from middle- to upper-middle-class families 
13  Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women)_ defeated (American Indians)_ repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior  The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior  They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings_ but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems  (We do not mean to suggest that women_ Indians_ etc  ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology )
14  Feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men  Clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men
